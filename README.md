# ML-algorithms-for-predicting-cryptocurrency-news-sentiment-analysis

## Abstract
In this project, the VADER algorithm is used for sentiment analysis. News related to three well-known cryptocurrencies, which include Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Cardano. Having done preprocessing operations, the polarity of each news headline is determined, and the sentiments are classified into three categories. Finally, well-known machine learning classification algorithms are employed for prediction, and their performance is evaluated using assessment metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected through an Application Programming Interface (API) called NewsAPI.
