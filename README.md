# ML-algorithms-for-predicting-cryptocurrency-news-sentiment-analysis


In this project, the VADER algorithm is used for sentiment analysis. News related to three well-known cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Cardano) is collected through an Application Programming Interface (API). After preprocessing, the polarity of each news headline is determined, and the sentiments are classified into three categories. Finally, well-known machine learning classification algorithms are employed for prediction, and their performance is evaluated using assessment metrics.
